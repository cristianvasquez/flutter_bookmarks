# Flutter bookmarks

Flutter bookmarks is a colorful Android application to store bookmarks and notes, inside kanban boards.

I made this application in the times of Covid-19 to teach myself [Dart](https://dart.dev/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).
The application has only been tested in a Tablet.

## Screenshots

The first screen is where you select your boards.

A board has panes with cards that you can drag around.

Each card can be edited with a rich editor, courtesy of [zephir](https://pub.dev/packages/zefyr).
